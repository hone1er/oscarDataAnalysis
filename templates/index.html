<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>
  The Oscars (also confusingly referred to as the Academy Awards) is a big
  awards ceremony in the eyes of Hollywood. Winning an Oscar is a sign of high
  status and recognition. How does one achieve such an award and is the academy
  fully transparent about the path to this esteemed recognition? We are here to
  find out. In this project we will be diving into the various factors that go
  into being nominated. We will first look at what the Academy states is the way
  to become nominated and then, as data geeks, we will hunt for the data to
  back-up or debunk the claims.

<h2>Our datasets:</h2>
<p>
  https://www.kaggle.com/sebask/the-oscars-dataset-preparing-for-2017/data
  https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data We will be using the
  above data sets (along with web scraping to gather years 2016-2019) to predict
  the best picture nomination.

<h2>We will be using the following:</h2>
<p>
  HTML/CSS to display our project, Python's Pandas library to web scrape/clean our data
  Tableau to interactively visualise our data. Further ideas we have are taking a
  look at each movies instagram followers, Youtube trailer plays, and Netflix
  streams to see how they trend throughout the year and whether or not there’s a
  correlation between the top trenders and the nominees. (i.e. how has social
  media changed the nomination game?)

<h2>How this is valuable:</h2>
<p>
  We will be able to show which aspects are the most valuable in predicting who
  will get nominated for a Oscar. Being nominated for an Oscar can make a huge
  difference in the financial prospects of the directors, actors, and everyone
  involved. With the understanding that we unearth, those in the movie business
  will be able to be more strategic with their resources because they’ll
  understand what will get them the most bang for their marketing buck.
